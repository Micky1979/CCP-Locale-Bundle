# Locale.bundle
A bundle containings .strings file to translate Clover Configurator Pro.app

## How to translate
**Clover Configurator Pro is multi language :
actually Italian and English are available at 100%, Portoguese is at 90% (thanks to Mirone),
but you can translate it easily by making a copy of Base.strings into your locale identifier suggested directly by Clover Configurator Pro in the upper right corner of the Preferences:**

**Fork the repository, edit the file, or as I said make a new one naming it as CCP suggested you.
Open a pull request, so that We can keep track of changes**
